Many blockchains have their own explorer, we will use this app as a custom made explorer like application and will use the Polkadot official explorer for all advanced stuff

**NOTE**

The workflow ID that is in side the Verify the domain is NOT the one that is tied to the `"wf_cidv1_from_array": "https://ipfs.anagolay.network/ipfs/bafybeiaaybkhln6hvfzh3cacos3km6bjqdmk4scfe2wite4g357owx5tma",` because WASMs that are for that CID do not work.

`bafkr4icijxzickvfhqfc4gef6exesry32rhyprv6piimbrigk37hagja3i` is the old one and connected to the `"wf_cidv1_from_array": "https://ipfs.anagolay.network/ipfs/bafybeiaaybkhln6hvfzh3cacos3km6bjqdmk4scfe2wite4g357owx5tma",`
